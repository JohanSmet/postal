# Postal

Source code of Postal by Running With Scissors, imported from their GPL [release](https://runningwithscissors.com/the-original-postal-has-been-made-open-source/) on bitbucket a few years ago.

## Overview of changes
- small series of changes to silence compiler warnings (not all, but most -Wall warnings on GCC/Clang)
- ported to 64-bit; builds and runs on modern Linux, Windows and (Intel) MacOS systems.

## Future plans
- ports to other systems (Xbox, M1 macs)
- actually properly testing the game.
